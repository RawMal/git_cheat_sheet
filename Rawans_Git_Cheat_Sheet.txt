BASIC TERMINAL NAVIGATION

◎ pwd → This allows you to find location of current file path 

◎ clear → This declutters your terminal window and allows you to have a cleaner work space

◎ ls → This lists whatever folder or file resides in your current location

◎ ls 'directory_name' → lists whatever folder or file resides in specific directory

◎ ls -l → This gives you extra information of the current contents of your location also known as a flag

◎ man ls → This gives you a directory of flags you can use to help navigate through your directories on Terminal

◎ cd 'directory_name' or cd Documents/directory_name→ Navigate into desired directory

◎ cd → Takes you back to the beginning of the file tree

◎ cd .. → Allows you to go back to previous directory, if you would like to go back further use 'cd …' etc.


BASIC TERMINAL FILE MANIPULATION

◎ mkdir 'directory_name' → Create a new directory at current location
