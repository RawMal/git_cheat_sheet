◎ ls → This lists whatever folder or file resides in your current location

◎ ls 'directory name' → lists whatever folder or file resides in specific directory

◎ ls -l → This gives you extra information of the current contents of your location also known as a flag

◎ man ls → This gives you a directory of flags you can use to help navigate through your directories on Terminal

◎ cd 'directory name' or cd Documents/directory_name→ Navigate into desired directory

◎ cd → Takes you back to the beginning of the file tree
